Hello Everyone!
My name is HIRA LAL. Not sure why I was named but my mom said I was deep red in color because of the RBCs in abundant at my birth and as soon as I was born lights went off and because of my fairness my face was glowing in the hospital like a diamond, hence the name Red Diamond or Hira Lal :)
